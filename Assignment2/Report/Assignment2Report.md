# Purpose

The purpose of this assignment is to complete the design of a 16-bit cryptographic
co-processor. The design process is divided amongst the two sections of this
assignment. Firstly, the combinational components of the design must be completed.
These components include an ALU, capable of performing addition and subtraction
operations, along with a number of logical operations, a Shifter, which can
shift or rotate the input bits, and a Lookup module, which substitutes the
input bits for a value specified in the provided lookup table.

The second section of this assignment focuses on the synchronous design elements,
i.e. the memory registers used to store the values output from the combinational
logic components.
